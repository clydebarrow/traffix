Receives ADSB traffic information via WiFi from a GDL90 source such as Stratux or SkyEcho.
Traffic can be displayed on a map, and/or relayed via a network port to other apps on the same device.

If you're a glider pilot using XCSoar on an Android device, this app will allow you to stream
SkyEcho traffic data and GPS location to XCSoar. Since XCSoar does not natively read GDL90 format
data, TraffiX receives data from a SkyEcho or other GDL90 source and converts it to FLARM format,
then retransmits this via a UDP port.

Then simply setting one of XCSoar's input devices to UDP, port 4353 and FLARM decoding will
result in ADSB traffic being displayed inside XCSoar just like FLARM traffic.

TraffiX will remain running in the background when XCSoar is active.

For setup instructions see the help page inside the app, or https://www.control-j.com/TraffiX
